Version: 1.3.1
Description: The class_loader package is a ROS-independent package for loading plugins during runtime and the foundation of the higher level ROS &quot;pluginlib&quot; library.
 class_loader utilizes the host operating system's runtime loader to open runtime libraries (e.g. .so/.dll files), introspect the library for exported plugin classes, and allows users to instantiate objects of these exported classes without the explicit declaration (i.e. header file) for those classes.
